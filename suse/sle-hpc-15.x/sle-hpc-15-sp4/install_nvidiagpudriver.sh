## Nvidia provide certified packages for SLES 15 SP4, so we only need to add the repositories and install the packages

# Install Cuda
NVIDIA_VERSION="525.85.12"
DRIVER_BRANCH_VERSION=${NVIDIA_VERSION%.*.*} # branch is like main version
CUDA_VERSION="11-8"          # need to be "-" and not "."

# to check whats all available in the repo
# zypper se --repo cuda-sles15-x86_64

# install latest cuda package
# the repo contains more versions, so for example we want cuda 11.3 the package name is "cuda-11-3"
#
# cuda 	                    Installs all CUDA Toolkit and Driver packages. Handles upgrading to the next version of the cuda package when it's released.
# cuda-11-8 	            Installs all CUDA Toolkit and Driver packages. Remains at version 11.8 until an additional version of CUDA is installed.
# cuda-toolkit-11-8 	    Installs all CUDA Toolkit packages required to develop CUDA applications. Does not include the driver.
# cuda-tools-11-8 	        Installs all CUDA command line and visual tools.
# cuda-runtime-11-8      	Installs all CUDA Toolkit packages required to run CUDA applications, as well as the Driver packages.
# cuda-compiler-11-8    	Installs all CUDA compiler packages.
# cuda-libraries-11-8 	    Installs all runtime CUDA Library packages.
# cuda-libraries-devel-11-8 	Installs all development CUDA Library packages.
# cuda-drivers 	            Installs all Driver packages. Handles upgrading to the next version of the Driver packages when they're released.

# due to NVIDIA bug in post-install of the nvidia-drivers for kernel-azure, we need to select and install nvidia-gfxG05-kmp-azure manually
# The cuda dependencies select packages with "-default" and then the (wrong) modules for kernel-default instead of kernel-azure got installed
